1. Install FUSE
Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/files/fuse-2.X/ and download the latest version (2.9.4 as of writing this)
Unpack the tar
Run the following commands as SUPERUSER in the extracted folder:
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    
    
2. Make project
Just run "make run" and the program will be compiled and loaded into the /tmp/fuse directory (one will be created if it doesn't exist).

The android-fs folder is the FUSE client app for Android
The fs folder is the FUSE client app for other Linux Systems
The webapp folder is the server app in ASP.NET (C#)
